Notes:

Ice Spike Stairs seems to be off and maybe Lonely Freezor
Pod bk ledge stairs

AgaTower usually doesn't have enough Key Door candidates
(Testing) Camera spots in Aga Tower: Push Statue, Lone Statue maybe?
(Testing Waterfall Now) Spiral stairs without keys look funny - change to Incognito instead of Normal

(Can't Fix yet) Key door on Layer 1 not working (Aga Tower)
(Can't Fix yet) Key door in HC Lobby E door not passable - look into it?
