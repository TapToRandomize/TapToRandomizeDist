02025388: Start of bytes for bosses defeated
08007EA8 handles alternate enemy loading

changing 080D7F18 to B3 makes the trick candle load ONLY after killing Cerberus, and seems to have no other side effects


080D7F18 seems to be in the spot used to load enemy graphics

As for the alternate enemy graphics loading branch, it loads its value at 0805F33A

Changing 080D858C to B5 solves that
