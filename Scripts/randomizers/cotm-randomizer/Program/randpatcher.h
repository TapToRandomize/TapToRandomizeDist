#define SPOILER_FILENAME "spoilerlog.txt"

// This patch grants dash boots at the same time as other initialization steps at
// the beginning of the game without needing to pick them up. Created by DevAnj.
#define IPS_AUTODASHBOOTS "ips/AutoDashBoots.ips"

// This patch allows placing DSS cards on pedestals, prevents them from timing out, and removes them from
// enemy drop tables. Created by DevAnj but drop and pedestal item replacements have been stripped out.
#define IPS_CARDMODE "ips/CardUp_v3_Custom.ips"

// This patch replaces enemy drops that included DSS cards. Created by DevAnj as part of the Card Up patch
// but modified for different replacement drops (lowered rate, potion instead of meat, and no Shinning Armor change on Devil).

// is used. Created by DevAnj.
#define IPS_CARDCOMBOSREVEALED "ips/CardCombosRevealed.ips"

// In lategame, the Trick Candle and Scary Candle load in the Cerberus and Iron Golem boss rooms after defeating
// Camilla and Twin Dragon Zombies respectively. If the former bosses have not yet been cleared (i.e., we have
// sequence broken the game and returned to the earlier boss rooms to fight them), the candle enemies will cause
// the bosses to fail to load and soft lock the game. This patches the candles to appear after the early
// boss is completed instead. Created by DevAnj.
#define IPS_CANDLEFIX "ips/CandleFix.ips"

// A Tackle block in Machine Tower will cause a softlock if you access the Machine Tower from the Abyss Stairway using the stone tower route with Kick Boots and not Double.
// This is a small level edit that moves that block slightly, removing the potential for a softlock. Created by DevAnj.
#define IPS_BLOCKFIX "ips/SoftlockBlockFix.ips"

#define IPS_MPCOMBOFIX "ips/MPComboFix.ips"

// Normally, you must clear the game with each mode to unlock subsequent modes, and complete the game at least once to be able to skip the introductory text crawl.
// This allows all game modes to be selected and the introduction to be skipped even without game/mode completion. Created by DevAnj.
